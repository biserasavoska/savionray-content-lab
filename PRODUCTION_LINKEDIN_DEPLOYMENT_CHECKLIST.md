## üîß Production Configuration Required

### 1. LinkedIn Developer App Settings

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Add production redirect URI to LinkedIn Developer App

1. Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps
2. Select your app
3. Go to **Auth** tab
4. Find **"Authorized redirect URLs for your app"**
5. **Add your production URL**:
   ```
   https://your-production-domain.com/api/auth/linkedin/callback
   ```

**Current URLs should include**:
```
‚úÖ http://localhost:3000/api/auth/linkedin/callback                           (dev)
‚úÖ https://savionray-content-lab-production-ffc1.up.railway.app/api/auth/linkedin/callback  (staging)
‚ùì https://your-production-domain.com/api/auth/linkedin/callback               (production)
```

### 2. Railway Production Environment Variables

If you have a separate production Railway service, verify these variables:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
DATABASE_URL=<production-database-url>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<production-secret>
```

**Important**:
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS for production
- ‚úÖ No trailing slashes on URLs
- ‚úÖ Production should have its own database
- ‚úÖ Production should have a different NEXTAUTH_SECRET

### 3. Verify Products Enabled

In LinkedIn Developer App ‚Üí **Products** tab:

```
‚úÖ Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect
‚úÖ Share on LinkedIn
```

**Note**: If moving from development to production mode, you may need LinkedIn's approval for these products.

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Step 1: Wait for Railway Deployment

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check deployment status
3. Wait for "Deployed" status
4. Check deployment logs for errors

### Step 2: Verify LinkedIn Cleanup Ran

In Railway deployment logs, you should see:

```
--- Cleaning up LinkedIn accounts with incorrect providerAccountId ---
üöÇ Railway LinkedIn Account Cleanup
=====================================
Found X LinkedIn accounts
...
‚úÖ Deleted X problematic LinkedIn accounts (or "All accounts have correct providerAccountId!")
```

### Step 3: Test LinkedIn Connection

1. **Open production URL**: `https://your-production-domain.com/profile`
2. **Log in** with production credentials
3. **Click "Connect LinkedIn"**
4. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ LinkedIn authorization dialog appears (not error page)
   - ‚úÖ Permissions shown include "Share on LinkedIn"
   - ‚úÖ Can click "Allow"
   - ‚úÖ Redirected back successfully
   - ‚úÖ "‚úì Connected" badge displayed
   - ‚úÖ Name and email shown
   - ‚úÖ Console shows no errors

### Step 4: Test Publishing (Optional)

1. Create a test content draft
2. Approve the content
3. Click "Publish to Social"
4. Select LinkedIn
5. Verify post appears on LinkedIn

---

## üö® Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong in production:

### Option 1: Quick Fix

If only LinkedIn integration is broken:

1. Users can still use all other features
2. LinkedIn connection will show "Not connected"
3. Publishing to LinkedIn will be disabled
4. Fix the configuration and redeploy

### Option 2: Full Rollback

If critical issues arise:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or reset to previous version
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push origin main --force
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Only use `--force` if absolutely necessary and team is aware.

## üìä Monitoring

### What to Monitor Post-Deployment

1. **Railway Deployment Logs**:
   - Check for startup errors
   - Verify cleanup script runs successfully
   - Watch for LinkedIn API errors

2. **Application Logs**:
   - Monitor `/api/auth/linkedin/*` endpoints
   - Watch for 401/403 errors (token issues)
   - Check for redirect_uri mismatch errors

3. **User Reports**:
   - LinkedIn connection failures
   - Publishing errors
   - Token expiration issues

### Expected Metrics

**Successful Connection Flow**:
- Status 307 ‚Üí Redirect to LinkedIn
- Status 200 ‚Üí LinkedIn callback success
- Status 307 ‚Üí Redirect to profile with success

**Failed Connection Flow**:
- Status 307 ‚Üí Redirect to LinkedIn
- LinkedIn shows error page (console errors)
- Indicates redirect_uri mismatch

## üîê Security Considerations

### Production-Specific Security

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - ‚úÖ Use different secrets for production
   - ‚úÖ Never commit production secrets to git
   - ‚úÖ Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Database**:
   - ‚úÖ Production database should be separate from staging
   - ‚úÖ Enable database backups
   - ‚úÖ Set up monitoring and alerts

3. **LinkedIn Tokens**:
   - ‚úÖ Tokens expire after 60 days
   - ‚úÖ Implement token refresh (future enhancement)
   - ‚úÖ Validate tokens before each use

4. **Rate Limits**:
   - Member: 150 posts/day
   - Application: 100,000 requests/day
   - Monitor usage to avoid hitting limits
