# Phase 3: Organization Switching & Context Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented organization switching and context management functionality, allowing users to seamlessly switch between organizations while maintaining proper data isolation and user experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Organization Context Provider (`src/lib/contexts/OrganizationContext.tsx`)
- **Global State Management**: Centralized organization state management using React Context
- **Automatic Organization Loading**: Fetches user's organizations on session initialization
- **Persistence**: Remembers user's last selected organization using localStorage
- **Organization Switching**: Handles organization switching with page refresh for context updates

### 2. Organization Switcher Component (`src/components/navigation/OrganizationSwitcher.tsx`)
- **Dropdown Interface**: Clean dropdown UI for organization selection
- **Organization Stats**: Shows idea and draft counts for each organization
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights current organization with checkmark
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. Updated Navigation (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)
- **Integrated Switcher**: Added organization switcher to main navigation
- **Context-Aware**: Only shows switcher when user is authenticated
- **Proper Styling**: Consistent with existing navigation design

### 4. Organization Context Hook (`src/hooks/useCurrentOrganization.ts`)
- **Easy Access**: Simple hook for accessing current organization data
- **Type Safety**: Properly typed organization information
- **Loading States**: Handles loading states for better UX

### 5. Organization Context Middleware (`src/lib/middleware/organization-context.ts`)
- **API Route Protection**: Middleware for organization-scoped API routes
- **Automatic Context**: Establishes organization context for API handlers
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for missing organizations
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 6. Updated Ideas Page (`src/app/ideas/page.tsx`)
- **Organization-Aware**: Only loads ideas for current organization
- **Loading States**: Shows loading state while organization context loads
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for organization-related issues
- **Empty States**: Better empty state handling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Context Provider Features
```typescript
interface OrganizationContextType {
  currentOrganization: Organization | null
  userOrganizations: Organization[]
  isLoading: boolean
  switchOrganization: (organizationId: string) => Promise<void>
  refreshOrganizations: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### Organization Switcher Features
