2. You should see a list of available LinkedIn products

### Required Products

You need **TWO** products enabled for this integration:

#### 1. Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect

**Purpose**: Allows users to authenticate with LinkedIn

**Scopes Provided**:
- `openid` - Required for OIDC

- `email` - User's email address

**If Not Added**:
1. Find "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" in the list
2. Click **"Request access"** or **"Add product"**
3. Fill out any required information
4. Wait for approval (usually instant)

#### 2. Share on LinkedIn

**Status**: Should show **"Added"** or **"Verification Required"**

**Purpose**: Allows posting to LinkedIn on behalf of users

**Scopes Provided**:
- `w_member_social` - Post to LinkedIn feed

**If Not Added**:
