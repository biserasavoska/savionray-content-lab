# üö® URGENT: Rollbar Environment Variables Setup

## ‚úÖ Code is Deployed
The Rollbar integration code has been merged to main and pushed. Your staging/production will now have the Rollbar code.

## üîß Environment Variables Needed

You **MUST** add these environment variables to your staging and production environments:

### **Staging Environment:**
```bash
ROLLBAR_SERVER_ACCESS_TOKEN=04c4928a2f754ab0bdc091733c7a8e26
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLBAR_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=5edea99b9891476885963e63bbbe691c
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0-staging
NODE_ENV=staging
```

### **Production Environment:**
```bash
ROLLBAR_SERVER_ACCESS_TOKEN=04c4928a2f754ab0bdc091733c7a8e26
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLBAR_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=5edea99b9891476885963e63bbbe691c
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NODE_ENV=production
```

## üéØ Where to Add These:

### **Railway:**
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add each environment variable
5. Redeploy your service

### **Vercel:**
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable for the appropriate environments
4. Redeploy

### **Other Platforms:**
Add the environment variables in your deployment platform's environment settings.

## üß™ Test After Setup:

Once you've added the environment variables and redeployed:

1. **Visit your staging/production test page:**
   - `https://your-staging-domain.com/test-rollbar`
   - `https://your-production-domain.com/test-rollbar`

2. **Click test buttons** to trigger errors

3. **Check Rollbar dashboard** for new errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Nothing is Moving:

Without the environment variables, Rollbar can't connect to your account, so no errors are being sent. The code is there, but it needs the tokens to work.

## üéØ Next Steps:

1. **Add environment variables** to your deployment platform
2. **Redeploy** your application
3. **Test** the integration
4. **Monitor** Rollbar dashboard for real errors

Once you add the environment variables, you'll start seeing real errors from your staging and production environments! üöÄ
