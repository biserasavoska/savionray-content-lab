2. **Type this exact command**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
3. **Click "Run"** or press Enter
4. **Wait for it to complete** (you'll see output in the logs)

1. **Go to**: https://savionray-content-lab-production.up.railway.app/
2. **Try logging in with**: `test@example.com` (any password)
3. **See if it works** - the system might create users automatically
