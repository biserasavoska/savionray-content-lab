# Phase 3 Completion Summary: Organization Switching and Context Management

## ✅ Successfully Implemented and Deployed

Phase 3 of the multi-tenant organization management system has been completed and successfully pushed to main. This phase focused on organization switching and context management throughout the application.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Organization Context Provider
- **File**: `src/components/OrganizationContext.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides organization context throughout the application
- **Features**:
  - Current organization state management
  - Organization switching functionality
  - User's organizations list management
  - Automatic organization loading on app start

### 2. Organization Switcher Component
- **File**: `src/components/OrganizationSwitcher.tsx`
- **Purpose**: UI component for switching between organizations
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown with user's organizations
  - Visual organization indicators (name, color)
  - Smooth switching with context updates
  - Responsive design

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- **File**: `src/components/navigation/RoleBasedNavigation.tsx`
- **Updates**:
  - Added OrganizationSwitcher to navigation
  - Organization-aware navigation items
  - Context-aware menu rendering

### 4. Organization Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/useOrganization.ts`
- **Purpose**: Custom hook for accessing organization context
- **Features**:
  - Current organization access
  - Organization switching
  - Loading states
  - Error handling

### 5. API Middleware Enhancement
- **File**: `src/lib/middleware/organization.ts`
- **Purpose**: Middleware for organization context in API routes
- **Features**:
  - Automatic organization context injection
  - Organization-aware API responses
  - Error handling for missing organization context

### 6. Organization-Aware Ideas Page
- **File**: `src/app/ideas/page.tsx`
- **Updates**:
  - Integrated with organization context
  - Organization-specific idea filtering
  - Context-aware data fetching

## 🔧 Critical Fix Applied

### OrganizationProvider Integration
- **Issue**: React error "useOrganization must be used within an OrganizationProvider"
- **Root Cause**: RootClientWrapper wasn't wrapping children with OrganizationProvider
- **Fix**: Updated `src/components/RootClientWrapper.tsx` to include OrganizationProvider
- **Result**: Organization context now available app-wide

## 📊 Database Integration

### Organization-Aware Queries
- All content queries now filter by `organizationId`
- Ideas, drafts, and other content are organization-scoped
- User permissions are organization-specific
- Data isolation between organizations maintained

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

### Test Script Created
- **File**: `scripts/test-organization-context.js`
- **Purpose**: Verify organization context functionality
- **Features**:
  - Organization switching tests
  - Context availability verification
  - API integration testing

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### ✅ Successfully Deployed
